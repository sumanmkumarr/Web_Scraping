1st create virtual environment

A virtual environment in Python is like a special toy box 📦 where you keep only the tools (libraries or packages) you need for one specific project.

❓ Why is it Used?
Without a virtual environment, all Python projects share the same big toy box. This causes problems if:

One project needs an old version of a tool 📉

Another needs a new version 📈

Using virtual environments:
✅ You keep things separate
✅ Your project won’t break because of other projects


Create Virtual Environment by following command
python -m venv myenv


Activate the Virtual Environment by following command
myenv\Scripts\activate
